# discache ü¶Ä
Every time you view an Image in Discord, it gets saved in your cache folder as an unviewable file. 
**Discache** allows you to convert those files back to viewable pictures.

This tool works with vanilla Discord. 
You won't need to have any
3rd party programs such as **[BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)**.
